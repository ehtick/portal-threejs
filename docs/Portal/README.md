# Portal Three.js

A browser-based recreation of Valve's Portal using React Three Fiber, bringing the iconic puzzle-platformer experience to the web with authentic physics, mechanics, and atmosphere.

## Vision

Portal Three.js aims to capture the essence of Portal's innovative gameplay, memorable characters, and distinctive aesthetic in a modern web environment. Built with performance and accessibility in mind, this project demonstrates what's possible when cutting-edge web technologies meet timeless game design.

## Features

-   **Authentic Portal Mechanics**: Physics-based portal gun, momentum conservation, and spatial puzzles
-   **Dynamic Characters**: GLaDOS, Wheatley, Atlas, and P-Body with contextual AI-generated dialog
-   **Immersive Audio**: Spatial audio with ElevenLabs integration for dynamic character voices
