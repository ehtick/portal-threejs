# Portal Clone: Essential Mechanics List
Everything uses react three fiber and rapier physics

## Core Portal Mechanics

- **Portal Creation & Placement**
  - Blue and orange portal placement via primary/secondary fire
  - Surface compatibility detection (only certain surfaces accept portals)
  - Portal size and shape consistency
  - Portal placement validation (enough space, correct angle)
  - Portal replacement (new blue portal replaces old blue portal)

- **Portal Transportation**
  - Seamless visual transition between portals
  - Momentum conservation through portals
  - Orientation preservation relative to portal planes
  - Physics continuity (velocity and angular momentum preserved)
  - Line-of-sight visibility through portals

## Physics Interactions

- **Object Interaction**
  - Object pickup and carrying system
  - Throw/drop mechanics with momentum transfer
  - Weight simulation for carried objects
  - Collision detection between carried objects and environment

- **Momentum & Energy Conservation**
  - Terminal velocity from falls
  - Momentum preservation through portal transitions
  - "Fling" mechanics (using gravity and portals to gain speed)
  - Consistent physics behavior across teleportations

## Player Movement

- **First-Person Controls**
  - WASD movement with customizable sensitivity
  - Jump mechanics with appropriate height/distance
  - Crouch functionality
  - Look controls with mouse/camera movement
  - Movement speed consistency

- **Player Physics**
  - Player collision with environment
  - Fall damage for excessive heights
  - Player-object interactions
  - Portal traversal for player character

## Level Interaction Elements

- **Buttons & Triggers**
  - Pressure plates activated by weight
  - Timed button activation periods
  - Visual feedback for button states
  - Connection to door/platform mechanisms

- **Doors & Barriers**
  - Sliding door animations and physics
  - Energy barriers/fields (allow objects but not player, or vice versa)
  - Conditional activation based on puzzle state

- **Platforms & Movement**
  - Moving platforms on fixed paths
  - Platform timing synchronized with puzzles
  - Consistent physics on moving surfaces
  - Portal placement on moving surfaces (if supported)

## Environment Mechanics

- **Hazards**
  - Deadly floor surfaces (implied acid/energy)
  - Crushing mechanisms
  - Fall damage from excessive heights
  - Reset/respawn system on death

- **Puzzle Reset**
  - Level reset functionality
  - Object return to original positions
  - Portal clearing on reset
  - Player position reset

## Game Loop Elements

- **Level Progression**
  - Level completion detection
  - Clear exit/goal indicators
  - Transition between test chambers
  - Save/checkpoint system

- **Feedback Systems**
  - Visual cues for successful actions
  - Sound feedback for interactions
  - Portal placement feedback (success/failure)
  - Environmental response to player actions

## Technical Mechanics

- **Portal Rendering**
  - Recursive portal views (portals visible through portals)
  - Depth-limited recursion to prevent infinite loops
  - Proper clipping and stencil buffer usage
  - Frame-consistent portal views

- **Audio Propagation**
  - Sound transmission through portals
  - Spatial audio positioning
  - Environment-appropriate reverb and echo
  - Physics sound reactions (impacts, slides, etc.)

This list covers all the essential mechanics needed to create a functional Portal clone that captures the core gameplay experience. Each of these mechanics contributes to the distinctive puzzle-solving and physics-bending gameplay that made Portal so innovative.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
