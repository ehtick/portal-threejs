Here's a complete recap of everything we've covered that you might want to implement:

## Key Implementation Areas

### 1. Wheatley Behavior System
- **Four-Component Architecture**:
  - UIContext (Blackboard): Data store for all interaction state
  - WheatleyBehaviorTree (Controller): AI decision-making logic
  - WheatleyRig: Animation capabilities and movement execution
  - WheatleyMesh: 3D model with materials and visuals

- **Behavior Tree Implementation**:
  - Selector nodes (OR logic)
  - Sequence nodes (AND logic)
  - Condition nodes
  - Action nodes

### 2. Wheatley Behavior Ideas
- **Core Behaviors**:
  - Mouse tracking with occasional distraction
  - Self-correction head shake after distraction
  - Idle fidgeting movements

- **Advanced Behaviors**:
  - Nervous spinning when cursor moves quickly
  - Sleepy mode when cursor is inactive
  - Light flickering with surprised reaction
  - Proximity reactions when cursor gets too close
  - Environmental awareness (looking at UI elements)
  - Recognition of movement patterns

### 3. Menu Reactivity System
- **Character Swapping**:
  - Main menu: Wheatley as default character
  - Single Player: Atlas appears
  - Multiplayer: Atlas & P-body appear together
  - Options: Different objects for audio/video settings

- **Animation Reactions**:
  - Different animation states based on menu selection
  - Character-appropriate reactions to each menu item

### 4. Mixamo Integration
- **Animation Library**:
  - Using Mixamo animations with Atlas & P-body
  - File formats: FBX, glTF/GLB, or JSON
  - Animation system setup in Three.js

- **Animation State Machine**:
  - Transitions between different animations
  - Cross-fading for smooth movement changes
  - Animation mixer for controlling playback

### 5. Portal-Specific Elements
- **Characters**:
  - Wheatley (personality core)
  - Atlas & P-body (co-op robots)
  - GLaDOS components
  - Turrets

- **Environmental Elements**:
  - Test chambers
  - Portal surfaces
  - Interactive elements

This comprehensive approach combines character AI, animation systems, and themed menu interactions to create a truly immersive Portal experience that goes beyond simple visual recreation to capture the personality and feel of the original games.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
