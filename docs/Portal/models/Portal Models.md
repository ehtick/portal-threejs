# Essential 3D Models for Portal Clone

## Environment Models

- **Test Chamber Walls & Surfaces**
  - Standard wall panels (non-portal compatible)
  - White portal-compatible wall panels
  - Floor tiles (standard)
  - Ceiling panels
  - Corner/edge trim pieces

- **Structural Elements**
  - Door frames
  - Observation windows
  - Ventilation grates/panels
  - Support beams/columns
  - Metal trim pieces

- **Interactive Elements**
  - Button pedestal with red button
  - Floor pressure plates
  - Sliding door segments
  - Circular/iris doors
  - Energy barriers/fields

- **Level Features**
  - Exit door/elevator
  - Indicator lights/strips
  - Hazard markings/warning signs
  - Information panels/screens
  - Chamber number displays

## Interactive Objects

- **Companion Cube**
  - Weighted storage cube with pink heart design
  - Standard weighted cube (plain version)
  - Edgeless safety cube (sphere variant, if included)

- **Portal Gun**
  - First-person view model with animations
  - Third-person world model (if visible to other players)
  - Portal projectile effect (particle model)

- **Mechanical Elements**
  - Moving platforms
  - Extending bridges
  - Aerial faith plates (launchers)
  - Light bridges
  - Tractor beams (if included)

## Visual Effects Models

- **Portal Models**
  - Portal rim/edge with emissive properties
  - Portal surface/plane with shader capability
  - Portal placement effect (particle system)
  - Portal transition effect (player view distortion)

- **Environment Effects**
  - Hazardous liquid surface
  - Steam/vapor vents
  - Energy field emitters
  - Ambient particles
  - Impact effects

## Optional Additional Models

- **Decorative Elements**
  - Security cameras
  - Monitoring equipment
  - Pipes and conduits
  - Observation area furniture
  - Technical equipment/machinery

- **Player Elements** (if visible)
  - Player hands/arms for first-person view
  - Portal gun holding animations
  - Object interaction animations
  - Full player model (for shadows or multiplayer)

## Technical Requirements

- **LOD Variants**
  - Low-poly versions of complex models
  - Distance-appropriate detail levels
  - Optimized collision meshes

- **Material Requirements**
  - PBR material setup for modern rendering
  - Emissive maps for glowing elements
  - Normal maps for surface detail
  - Roughness/metallic maps for proper lighting

This list covers all the essential 3D models you'll need for a complete Portal clone. You mentioned you already have the portal gun and cube models, so you can focus on the environment and interactive elements next. The clean, clinical aesthetic of Portal makes the modeling work relatively straightforward compared to more organic environments.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
