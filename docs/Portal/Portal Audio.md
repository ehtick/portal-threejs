# Final Portal Sound Effects List

## Portal Gun Sounds
- **Primary Fire** (blue portal): High-pitched energy charging and release
- **Secondary Fire** (orange portal): Similar but slightly lower pitched energy sound
- **Portal Gun Idle**: Subtle electronic hum/pulse

## Portal Creation & Interaction
- **Portal Opening**: Distinctive "whoosh" with energy buildup
- **Portal Closing/Disappearing**: Reverse energy sound with slight implosion
- **Failed Portal Placement**: Error-like rejection sound
- **Portal Ambient Loop**: Subtle humming/buzzing while open

## Portal Travel
- **Portal Transit Sound**: Universal "swoosh" with slight pitch bend for all objects and players entering/exiting portals

## Physics Objects
- **Cube Pickup**: Subtle energy field activation
- **Cube Drop**: Solid thud with slight energy deactivation
- **Cube Landing on Button**: Distinctive "click" with success tone

## Environment
- **Button Press**: Mechanical click with hydraulic component
- **Button Release**: Reverse of press sound
- **Door Opening**: Mechanical/hydraulic sliding
- **Door Closing**: Heavier mechanical sound with finality
- **Pressure Plate Activation**: Weight-sensitive click with success tone

## Player Sounds
- **Footsteps**: Surface-specific (concrete, metal grating, etc.)
- **Jump**: Subtle effort sound
- **Land**: Impact sound based on surface and fall height
- **Fall Damage**: Impact with pain indication

## Atmosphere & Feedback
- **Success Jingle**: Short melody for puzzle completion
- **Failure Sound**: Distinctive tone for death/reset
- **Ambient Room Tone**: Low background hum for test chambers

## Physical Interactions
- **Surface Impacts**: Different sounds for various surfaces (concrete, metal, glass)
- **Momentum Preservation**: Dynamic sound scaling based on velocity
- **Ricochets**: Objects bouncing off walls with appropriate material sounds
- **Sliding**: Friction sounds for objects in motion
- **Falling Into Pit**: Distant impact or energy dissolution sound

## Technical Implementation
- **Fully Spatial Audio**: All sounds implemented with 3D positioning
- **Doppler Effect**: For moving sound sources
- **Reverb Zones**: Different acoustic properties for various chamber sizes
- **Portal Audio Transmission**: Sounds from other side of portals (filtered/muffled)
- **Distance Attenuation**: Volume falloff based on distance from sound source

This focused list contains all the essential sound effects needed for a functional Portal clone, with all audio implemented using spatial 3D techniques for complete immersion.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
