# Wheatley Dialog Summary

## Menu Navigation Responses

### Main Menu Options

#### Single Player

- "Oh! Starting fresh, are we? A blank slate! No mistakes yet. Well, none of yours anyway. Mine are... well, let's just focus on you for now."
- "New game! Exciting! Terrifying! Mostly terrifying actually. For me, not you. You'll be fine. Probably fine. Statistically speaking."

#### Continue Game

- "Continue where you left off? Good thinking. Efficiency! Though if you were really efficient, you might have finished already. Not judging! Just an observation."
- "Oh, picking up where you abandoned everything last time? I mean 'paused.' Paused is a better word. Less accusatory."

#### Load Game

- "Load game! Like time travel, but with less paradoxes. Hopefully less paradoxes. I haven't actually checked the paradox levels."
- "Loading a previous state! Very smart. Learn from past mistakes. Not that you made mistakes! I'm sure you were perfect. Or adequate. Minimum standards achieved, at least."

#### Back Option

- "Going back? Second thoughts? Perfectly natural. Healthy skepticism. Shows good judgment. Or crippling indecision. Could be either, really."

### Settings/Options Menu

#### Audio Settings

- "Audio settings! Very important. Very, very important. Too loud and it hurts your ears, too quiet and you miss important things... like me telling you important things. Bit of a paradox there."
- "Oh, audio adjustments! Brilliant. If I sound too panicky, that's not actually adjustable. That's just... that's just my personality. Sorry about that."

#### Video Settings

- "Video options! Resolution, graphics, all that technical stuff. Making things look nice or making things run smooth. Tradeoffs! Life is full of them. Like friendship and betrayal. Not that I'm thinking about that."
- "Display settings! Make everything look prettier or... less pretty but faster! Though between you and me, sometimes I think ignorance is bliss. Not seeing things clearly has its advantages."

#### Controls Settings

- "Controls! Right, very important these. Wouldn't want to press the wrong button at a critical moment. Not that I've ever done that. Well, there was that one time... actually, never mind."
- "Ah, remapping the controls! Clever. Very clever. Taking control of your destiny. Or at least, control of your controller. Much safer that way."

#### General Settings

- "Settings! The place where you can tinker with things until they're either perfect or completely broken. It's usually one or the other. No middle ground in my experience."

## Multiplayer Commentary

- "Oh, god. Multiplayer. You real... you really wanna double down on the fun?"
- "Oh, you can't handle single player all by yourself?"

## Context-Aware Comments

### Repeated Menu Visits

- "Oh, back again? Didn't get it right the first time? Join the club. Story of my life, really. Try, fail, try again, fail slightly differently..."

### Indecisive Navigation

- "I'm noticing a pattern of indecision here. Not judging! It's just... you've looked at every option at least twice now. Everything alright? Decision paralysis? I get that sometimes. All the time, actually."
